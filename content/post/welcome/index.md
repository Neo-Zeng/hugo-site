## Personal self-introduction

I was born in Nanjing, one of the most developed cities in China, boasting a rich history that encompasses both moments of sorrow and glory. Despite some chapters of its history being marked by sadness, Nanjing holds a special place in my heart. It is not just a city; it is my exact and only hometown.

Having spent the first 23 years of my life in Nanjing, I've developed a deep connection to its culture, traditions, and the warmth of its people. The city's historical tapestry, though at times somber, contributes to its unique identity.

Outside of my hometown, I have a profound love for outdoor activities and a keen interest in delving into the annals of history through reading. Whether it's exploring nature's wonders or immersing myself in the narratives of the past, these pursuits bring me a sense of fulfillment and joy.

I find solace and inspiration in the great outdoors. Hiking allows me to witness the grandeur of nature, and engaging in group sports activities provides me with an opportunity to share my enthusiasm with others. Simultaneously, my passion for history is fulfilled through extensive reading, allowing me to delve into different cultures, historical figures, and events, gaining wisdom and insights along the way.

Beyond my personal interests, I am also fascinated by societal issues and cultural diversity. I aspire to contribute to the progress and harmony of society through my understanding and efforts.

In essence, I am someone who cherishes life, possesses a curious mind, and embraces the spirit of exploration. I believe that each experience is a treasure, and I eagerly anticipate the challenges and growth that the future holds.
